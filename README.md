The Nvidia Stock Price and Volume Analysis Dashboard is an interactive tool built using Dash, Plotly, and Python, fetching real-time stock data from the Alpha Vantage API. It features six types of visualizations to analyze stock trends and includes a Predictive Model using 'Linear Extrapolation' to forecast the next closing price based on historical trends. The model calculates the average daily stock price change and projects future values, while Volume-Based Analysis determines potential price increases or decreases based on trading activity. The dashboard also provides dynamic tables, dropdown filters, and color-coded indicators for better trend interpretation.
